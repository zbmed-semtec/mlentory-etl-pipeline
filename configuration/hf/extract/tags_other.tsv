tag_name	description
Inference Endpoints	Indicates the model supports deployment through HuggingFace's managed inference API service for production environments.
AutoTrain Compatible	Models that can be fine-tuned using HuggingFace's AutoTrain service without requiring manual code.
text-generation-inference	Optimized backend for deploying and serving Large Language Models (LLMs) with high performance.
Eval Results	Models with published evaluation metrics, benchmarks, or test results available for review.
Has a Space	Indicates a HuggingFace Space demo exists for this model allowing interactive testing without setup.
4-bit precision	Models quantized to 4-bit precision, reducing memory footprint while maintaining reasonable performance.
custom_code	Models with custom implementation code beyond standard library functionality.
Merge	Models created by merging multiple other models, often to combine their strengths or capabilities.
Carbon Emissions	Models with documented carbon footprint information related to their training process.
8-bit precision	Models quantized to 8-bit precision, balancing performance and memory efficiency.
Mixture of Experts	Architecture where multiple specialized sub-models (experts) are conditionally activated based on input.
